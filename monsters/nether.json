    "description": "An enormous disembodied eyeball the size of a person, flying through the air through some unknown agency.  Wreathed in unnatural flickering blue flame, it possesses a blazing yellow iris with a slitted pupil like that of a cat, and trails a set of flailing black tendrils as it slowly drifts about.  Its unearthly presence fills you with dread at the prospect of falling under its baleful gaze.",
